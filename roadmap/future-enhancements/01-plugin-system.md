# 1. Plugin System

## Description

To foster a community of developers and allow for maximum extensibility, a plugin system could be implemented. This would allow third-party developers to create and share their own plugins that add new features, visualizations, or analysis to the core application.

## Functionality

*   **Plugin Architecture:** Define a clear and well-documented plugin architecture. This would include:
    *   An API for plugins to access parsed data.
    *   Hooks into the UI to allow plugins to add their own tabs, windows, or widgets.
    *   A manifest file for each plugin to declare its dependencies and capabilities.
*   **Plugin Manager:** A UI for users to browse, install, uninstall, and manage their plugins.
*   **Sandboxing:** A security model to sandbox plugins, preventing them from accessing sensitive user data or compromising the application's stability.

## Requirements

*   A flexible and modular application architecture that allows for easy extension.
*   A well-defined API for plugins to interact with the core application.
*   A secure way to load and execute third-party code.

## Limitations

*   Building a robust plugin system is a significant engineering effort.
*   Poorly written plugins could cause performance issues or crashes.

## Dependencies

*   A mature core application with a stable API is a prerequisite for a successful plugin system. This feature should only be considered after the core and advanced features are well-established.
