# 4. API Exposure

## Description

This feature involves exposing the parsed data and analysis through an API (Application Programming Interface). This would allow other developers to build third-party tools, websites, or integrations on top of the DAoC Log Parser.

## Functionality

*   **RESTful API:** Design and implement a RESTful API with endpoints for:
    *   Retrieving combat logs.
    *   Getting player statistics.
    *   Querying for specific fight details.
*   **Authentication:** Implement an authentication mechanism (e.g., API keys) to secure the API and control access.
*   **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI) to make it easy for developers to use the API.
*   **Webhooks:** Offer a webhook system to allow third-party applications to be notified of new events in real-time (e.g., a new combat session has been parsed).

## Requirements

*   A web framework for building the API (e.g., Flask/Django for Python, ASP.NET Core for C#).
*   A solid understanding of API design principles (REST, HATEOAS).
*   A secure authentication and authorization system.

## Limitations

*   Exposing an API adds a layer of complexity and security considerations.
*   The API needs to be carefully designed to be stable and maintainable over time.

## Dependencies

*   **03-database-integration.md:** A database is almost essential for a robust API, providing a reliable backend for data storage and retrieval.
*   The API would serve data generated by all the **core-features**.
